=========================

CakePHP Helpers to generate HTML with @Twitter Boostrap style (<strong>version 3.0</strong>).

It's a work in progress, if you want to add any kind of bootstrap components, just do it!

If you want a component but you don't really know how to do, do not hesitate to contact me!

**Warning:** Works only with CakePHP 2.x!

How to use?
===========

Just add Helper files into your View/Helpers directory and load the helpers in you controller:
```public $helpers = array('BoostrapHtml', 'BootstrapForm', 'BoostrapPaginator', 'BootstrapNavbar') ;```

I tried to keep CakePHP helpers style. You can find the documentation directly in the Helpers files.
